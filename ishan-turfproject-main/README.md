# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some Oxlint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Oxc](https://oxc.rs)
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/)

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Backup and restore

This project includes a Supabase backup script that exports the app tables to a gzip-compressed JSON file and uploads it to the configured storage bucket.

Environment variables required for the backup job:

```bash
export SUPABASE_URL="https://<project-ref>.supabase.co"
export SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="<service-role-key>"
export SUPABASE_BACKUP_BUCKET="backups"
export SUPABASE_BACKUP_RETENTION_MONTHS="12"
```

Run a manual backup:

```bash
npm run backup
```

Restore the latest backup from storage:

```bash
npm run backup:restore latest
```

If you want to restore a specific local backup file, pass its path instead:

```bash
npm run backup:restore ./tools/backups/backup-2026-09-26T12-00-00-000Z.json.gz
```

## Expanding the Oxlint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend enabling type-aware lint rules by installing `oxlint-tsgolint` and editing `.oxlintrc.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "./node_modules/oxlint/configuration_schema.json",
  "plugins": ["react", "typescript", "oxc"],
  "options": {
    "typeAware": true
  },
  "rules": {
    "react/rules-of-hooks": "error",
    "react/only-export-components": ["warn", { "allowConstantExport": true }]
  }
}
```

See the [Oxlint rules documentation](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter/rules) for the full list of rules and categories.
